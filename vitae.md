## Rockwell Collins

| **Title**  | Ph.D. Intern |
| **Time Frame**  | 2013 --- present |


*Formal Software Verification (2015-present)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> [AutoCorress](http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/autocorres/) is
an extension to the
[Isabelle Theorem Prover](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) that encodes a
large subset of the C programming language into a monadic form better
suited for human reasoning, *i.e.*, it closely resembles the original
code. My task is to understand how to effectively use AutoCorress to
verify relevant properties relating to Rockwell Collins work on the 
[SMACCMS](http://loonwerks.com/projects/smaccm.html) project.


*Automated System Requirement Verification (2013-2015)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Primary developer of [SpeAR](https://github.com/AFifarek/SpeAR), a
tool for system requirement specification and verification. SpeAR
accepts formalized requirements and translated these requirements to a
synchronous dataflow language. Another tool,
[jkind](https://github.com/agacek/jkind), translated this synchronous
dataflow language to specifications suitable for SMT solvers.  Through
this series of translation, some properties of the specified system
requirements could be verified in an automated fashion. SpeAR is
written in [Java](https://www.java.com/) using the
[Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/) with the
[xtext](https://www.itemis.com/en/xtext/download/) plugin.


## Lockheed Martin

| **Title**  | Senior Member of the Engineering Staff |
| **Time Frame**  | 2003 --- 2011 |

*Malware Provenance (2010 --- 2011)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Applied statistical modeling techniques to data retrieved via analysis
of binary malware in an attempt to recover authorship information.

*Transparent Protocol Layer Altering Network Device (2005 --- 2010)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Worked with team members in the Advanced Technology Laboratory to
design and implement a network device that could alter standard
protocol behaviors to better suit network characteristics. The
modifications to protocol behavior were implemented such that clients
required no modification or non-standard configuration. The system
allowed for easy modification of protocol behavior through
configuration files and served as an experiment platform for new
protocol modifications. The device was tested during a number of live
aerial exercises. Later revisions of this project relied extensively
on the [Click Modular Router](http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/click/click).

*Buffer Overflow Mitigation (2003 --- 2004)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Developed an experimental technique and framework that allowed buffer
overflows to be detected and mitigated in c code at runtime. The
prototype framework for this technique used the [C Intermediate
Language](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/) to transform
programs into ones that would dynamically increase buffer size upon
detection of overruns. Buffer overruns were detected using
[electric fence]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Fence).

## University of Minnesota

| **Title**  | Teaching Assistant |
| **Time Frame**  | 2011 --- 2015 |

*Advanced Programming Principles Principles (x3)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> Students were introduced to techniques for creating correct, robust, modular
> programs including: computing with symbolic data, recursion/induction,
> functional programming, impact of evaluation strategies,
> organizing data/computations around types, search-based programming,
> informal reasoning about programs.

*Program Design and Development (x3)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> A project based course intended to expose students to:
> principles of programming design/analysis, concepts in software
> development, large development using C/C++, data structures,
> debugging, files, I/O, state machines, testing, and coding standards.

*Programming Languages (x2)*
{: style="text-align: center"}

> This course had two primary goals: (1) to expose students to language
> design principles, concepts, constructs; (2) to make students more familiar
> with language paradigms and their applications.
