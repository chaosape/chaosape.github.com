title: Changing the website framework.
---

It is my goal for this website be a place where I share my work with
the world regularly. In fact, that has always been my primary goal of
maintain a website. I was previously using
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) to generate content but the process to
go from content generation to publishing was too involved; it required
that I remember how to use my hand-rolled emacs functions, managing
hand-rolled stylesheets, and moving the generated website to my
webserver; I need an even framework which requires little more than
me generating content. Therefore, I am moving
to new web infrastructure based on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
(supported natively by GitHub pages). In this framework, publishing
new content should be as simple as writing a text file in Jekyll's
variant of markdown, committing, and pushing my content to GitHub.
